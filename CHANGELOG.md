# [2.0.0](https://github.com/bootstrap-styled/provider/compare/v1.5.3...v2.0.0) (2019-12-02)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **utilities:** deprecate old utilities, they will be removed in futur version. Please now use new
variant. If necessary, enabled old implementation back as described in the documentation
* **utilities:** align, background, border, clearfix, display, flex, float, position, screenreaders,
sizing, spacing, text, visibility are now disabled. display and media have been added and can be
used to replace. They also migrated the theme colors, so far we keep using $brand-primary for v4
components, but they now use $primary, etc... names and if you want to get those utilities with the
proper colors, you will need to use the new naming convention. (in addition of the old naming
convention until they get removed and unused from v4 and others libs)
