Merge `dev` into `master` will release the documentation and tag a new version.
 
It will also prepare a next version in `dev`.

Before each release, members should check the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) that it is well filled with all change.

If the next version is a patch or major update, edit the version in `package.json` then merge your change into `master`.

If the next version is a bug fix, just merge your change into `master`.
